  title: A Call for Speakers, Topics of Interest, and Grant Requests
  content1: The 2016 Regional Americas Meeting of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) will be held in the city of Montevideo with approximately 500 participants expected from government, civil society, the media, and business.
  content2: In this edition, and in line with the principles of cooperation and participation which drive the OGP, we call on event participants to make contributions to the development of a thematic agenda that reflects the interests and priorities of the regional Open Government community.  As a unifying thread, we will develop the idea discussed at the Global Summit in Mexico of the Post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals, by focusing on how open government can contribute to their promotion in the region from the particular perspective of human development.
  content3: To that end, instead of issuing a traditional call for speakers, we invite anyone interested in participating as a speaker or workshop facilitator to fill in the attached form, selecting the topics that interest you and/or add those you feel are relevant, as well as applying by explaining the possible contributions you could make to up to three subject areas relative to the given categories.
  content4: We are looking to create a more dynamic and collaborative agenda by experimenting with sessions that are more participatory and characterized by exchanges among the participants, as well as having workshops in which the attendees’ capacity can be strengthened in different issue areas which contribute to the development of national action plans.  For this reason, the event’s Academic Committee requests possible contributions to the topic, in order to then invite the speakers to jointly create interactive sessions comprised of exchanges.
  content5: Event registration will open at a later date; as such, we invite everyone to participate in this call, even if you are not absolutely sure you can attend and with the reassurance that it is not obligatory for subsequent registration.

  title: Funding of civil society actors
  content1: "The Articles of Governance say the following about Civil Society Participation in the Regional Meeting: The Support Unit is to fund the travel of a certain number of local civil society representatives from OGP participating countries, contingent on available resources. All steps of the process to select local civil society representatives from OGP participating countries will be made public on the OGP website."
  content2: Civil society participation in the OGP Regional Meeting and all other outreach events is based on the principle of open invitation. Governments do not determine which civil society organizations attend from their countries, and they have no veto power. Regarding funded civil society participants at the Regional Meeting, the OGP Support Unit works with the civil society chairs to establish a transparent process to identify the most appropriate participation for each country. In addition to the OGP-funded civil society participants attending the Regional Meeting, other civil society organizations are invited using pre-defined criteria, pending availability of space as determined by the civil society chair in consultation with the other chairs.
  title2: Criteria for determining participation and funding for civil society actors
  content3: Civil society participation in the OGP Regional Meeting and all other outreach events is based on the principle of open invitation. If space is limited, the below criteria will be used to prioritize civil society participation. Please note IRM researchers applying for funding will be referred to the IRM team.
  content4: The OGP budget includes funding for civil society participation. While registering, civil society actors will be asked if they need funding to attend the summit. For those indicating this need the OGP Support Unit will use the same criteria to prioritize participants. It will also reach out to other funders to see if they could facilitate participation of some of the requesters. Funded participants will be asked to play an active role at the event (i.e. organize or take part in a session). The OGP Support Unit will additionally strive to strike a geographical and gender balance and fund actors working on a diversity of open government topics.
  content5: The Civil Society Engagement team is process lead for the below.
  content6: "The following criteria are to be used to prioritize civil-society funding recipients:"
  content7: "<b>Priority 1:</b> Civil society from an OGP member country belonging to the national OGP Steering Committee/core team."
  content8: "<li>If more than one CS fits this criteria, CSE team will ask core team to decide among themselves.</li>"
  content9: "<b>Priority 2:</b> Civil society actors active at regional/international level including those from multi-stakeholder initiatives and issue-based coalitions/networks currently working on OGP."
  content10: "<li>The Support Unit will decide based on the relevant OGP activities such actors have employed to date (e.g. support of local processes; participation in working groups; pledges, etc.)</li>"
  content11: "<b>Priority 3:</b> Civil society from an OGP member country that has been involved in national OGP process. The Support Unit will prioritize:"
  content12: "<li>CSOs supporting implementation or monitoring of specific commitments</li><li>CSOs monitoring the overall OGP process</li><li>CSOs working closely with the core team and/or lined-up to join core team</li>"
  content13: "<b>Priority 4:</b> Civil society from OGP eligible – non-member countries that are pushing for membership. The Support Unit will prioritize:"
  content14: "<li>CSOs leading OGP membership advocacy efforts</li>"
  content15: "<b>Priority 5:</b> Civil society from non-eligible OGP countries that are pushing for eligibility."
  content16: "<li>CSOs leading the eligibility advocacy efforts</li>"
  content17: "<b>Priority 6:</b> Civil society from an OGP member country that have interest in engaging with the national OGP process. The Support Unit will prioritize:"
  content18: "<li>CSOs with a solid track record on open government / topics intersecting with open government</li><li>CSOs national core team / government would like to bring into the process</li>"

selection_process:
  title: Selection Process
  content1: The selection process will be coordinated by the Organizing Committee, comprised of representatives from the Uruguayan government (AGESIC), civil society (Open Government Network), and OGP’s Support Unit.  Said committee will be assisted by an Academic Committee created especially for this occasion that will receive support from academia.
  content2: "The following are key dates to keep in mind:\n<ul><li>Tuesday March 1 - <strong>Call for speakers, topics of interest, and grant requests</strong></li>\n<li>Friday, March 31 - <strong>End of the call for speakers, topics of interest, and grant requests</strong></li>\n<li>Friday, April 1 - <strong>Registration opens</strong></li>\n<li>April 1-21 - <strong>Deliberations of the Academic Committee and development of the general agenda</strong></li>\n<li>Friday, April 22 - <strong>Deadline for contacting chosen speakers and grantees</strong></li>\n<li>April 22-May 20 - <strong>Co-creation of sessions by speakers</strong></li>\n<li>May 31 - <strong>Civil Society Day</strong></li>\n<li>June 1 & 2 - <strong>EncuentroRegional Americas Encounter of the Open Government Partnership</strong></li>\n</ul>"
  content3: "Once the call for speakers, topics of interest, and grant requests has closed, the Academic Committee will focus on the task of assembling sessions on the agenda <strong>in accordance with the most oft-proposed topics and the OGP’s priority issues and groups of speakers, each led by a facilitator who will carry out the sessions</strong>."
  content4: "Those selected to serve as speakers and facilitators will be contacted via email prior to April 22 and will have three business days to confirm their participation, including those requiring assistance for transport and lodging costs.  Those who accept will receive additional details regarding the layout of the sessions, including points of contact for matters related to content and logistics.  The selection results will be published on the website (<a href=\"http://ogpmontevideo.uy\">ogpmontevideo.uy</a>) after all speakers and facilitators have confirmed their participation."
  content5: Each session’s facilitator is responsible to the Academic Committee for assembling his/her session, as well as for ensuring that a proposal jointly created with the rest of the speakers is submitted to the Committee prior to May 20.  The Academic Committee will suggest to the facilitators a series of possible formats for the sessions, notwithstanding the latter’s proposal of others.  We will particularly insist that sessions promote dialogue more so than statements, as well as the exchange of ideas among the speakers, audience, [and] training entities, as well as external participation in the form of questions, interactive formats, or use of online tools.

  title_0: About Datacamp
  content0: On May 30, before the start of official event activities, we'll have this experimentatation and learning space. participants will learn how to find, extract and analyze public data, using forensic tools to tell better journalistic stories. It'll offer journalists, civic activists and developers a crash course in the most important teqniques and tools to analyze public data, They'll also work in teams to create newsapps and civic participation tools that enhance the value of traditional reporting.
  title_1: About Civil Society Day
  content1: On May 31 there will be an unconference organized by civil society groups in order to address subjects related to them. An unconference implies an open agenda co-created on the spot by the participants, as well as sessions for peer knowledge exchange, which will be led by facilitators. Although the event is not exclusive to civil society representatives, these will receive preference in the filling of the 150 available spaces.
  content2: "In an unconference, the speaker-listeners dynamic is inverted so that all of the participants become both speakers and listeners. In several simultaneous sessions, each with a limited number of people, a dialogue is fostered based on the topics chosen from the common agenda. Each session has a facilitator who ensures that everyone has equal opportunity to hear and be heard, as well as a someone that volunteers to take notes to be shared with the rest of the participants and any interested person via the web."
  content3: "In the sessions there is no use of multimedia presentations or electronic devices such as cell phones and laptops (except for the individual taking notes).<br><br>The goal of an unconference is for knowledge to be shared among peers, and its setup helps foster this. Facilitators guide the participants during the day, but ultimately it is the attendees themselves that make the event and generate its content. The event will include coffee in the morning and afternoon, as well as lunch for all attendees."
  title2: About the Americas Regional Meeting
  description1: The conference will take place on June 1 and 2, with a program based on the themes that were proposed during the registration process, that were received during the call for submissions in March, or that were deemed relevant by the Academic Committee.
  description2: In the interest of being more dynamic and collaborative, the agenda includes more participative sessions instead of a traditional, exposition-based program. For this reason, the Academic Committee of the event requested contributions to the themes, rather than traditional presentations, so that speakers could then be invited to co-create sessions built around exchange and interaction.
  description3: "The event will have three principal tracks:"
  title3: Presentations and sessions in the main hall
  description4: These will include simultaneous translation and will aim to foster dialogue between the speakers and the audience.
  title4: Lightning talks in the lobby
  description5: Brief presentations from all OGP member countries in the region – by their governmental, civil society, and Independent Reporting Mechanism representatives. There will also be a series of brief presentations of regional initiatives and projects.
  title5: Classroom Workshops
  description6: Lasting more than two hours and conducted by first-class experts, these workshops will aim to foster deep and practical learning on concepts for audiences with varying levels of experience.
  description7: In more general terms, this gathering will recognize the value of interpersonal exchanges and “hallway talk,” and it will therefore open spaces between sessions for interaction, will provide materials for the exchange of ideas in common areas (flipcharts, markers, etc.), and will welcome the use of the lobby for meetings during the event.
  coffee: The event will include coffee in the morning and afternoon, as well as lunch for all attendees.
  title6: "Abot the <br>Focal Point<br> meeting (not open to the public)"
  description8: On May 31, continuing the successful experiences in Mexico, Georgia and Tanzania, a conference will be held for government POC from countries participating in OGP from the region.
  title7: "This conference will have the following objectives:"
  description9: Through facilitated discussions and participatory sessions, participants will have the opportunity to reflect and learn on innovative practices in OGP-related topics.
  title8: Foster best practices.
  description10: Along the day, POC will have the chance to compare processes with other regional countires and identify good practices and common problems.
  title9: Opportunity for collaboration networks.
  description11: This will allow reformers establish solid working relationships and identify new opportunities for collaboration and alliances on key subjects.
