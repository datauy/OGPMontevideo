  title: A Call for Speakers, Topics of Interest, and Grant Requests
  content1: The 2016 Regional Americas Meeting of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) will be held in the city of Montevideo with approximately 500 participants expected from government, civil society, the media, and business.
  content2: In this edition, and in line with the principles of cooperation and participation which drive the OGP, we call on event participants to make contributions to the development of a thematic agenda that reflects the interests and priorities of the regional Open Government community.  As a unifying thread, we will develop the idea discussed at the Global Summit in Mexico of the Post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals, by focusing on how open government can contribute to their promotion in the region from the particular perspective of human development.
  content3: To that end, instead of issuing a traditional call for speakers, we invite anyone interested in participating as a speaker or workshop facilitator to fill in the attached form, selecting the topics that interest you and/or add those you feel are relevant, as well as applying by explaining the possible contributions you could make to up to three subject areas relative to the given categories.
  content4: We are looking to create a more dynamic and collaborative agenda by experimenting with sessions that are more participatory and characterized by exchanges among the participants, as well as having workshops in which the attendees’ capacity can be strengthened in different issue areas which contribute to the development of national action plans.  For this reason, the event’s Academic Committee requests possible contributions to the topic, in order to then invite the speakers to jointly create interactive sessions comprised of exchanges.
  content5: Event registration will open at a later date; as such, we invite everyone to participate in this call, even if you are not absolutely sure you can attend and with the reassurance that it is not obligatory for subsequent registration.

  title: Funding of civil society actors
  content1: "The Articles of Governance say the following about Civil Society Participation in the Regional Meeting: The Support Unit is to fund the travel of a certain number of local civil society representatives from OGP participating countries, contingent on available resources. All steps of the process to select local civil society representatives from OGP participating countries will be made public on the OGP website."
  content2: Civil society participation in the OGP Regional Meeting and all other outreach events is based on the principle of open invitation. Governments do not determine which civil society organizations attend from their countries, and they have no veto power. Regarding funded civil society participants at the Regional Meeting, the OGP Support Unit works with the civil society chairs to establish a transparent process to identify the most appropriate participation for each country. In addition to the OGP-funded civil society participants attending the Regional Meeting, other civil society organizations are invited using pre-defined criteria, pending availability of space as determined by the civil society chair in consultation with the other chairs.
  title2: Criteria for determining participation and funding for civil society actors
  content3: Civil society participation in the OGP Regional Meeting and all other outreach events is based on the principle of open invitation. If space is limited, the below criteria will be used to prioritize civil society participation. Please note IRM researchers applying for funding will be referred to the IRM team.
  content4: The OGP budget includes funding for civil society participation. While registering, civil society actors will be asked if they need funding to attend the summit. For those indicating this need the OGP Support Unit will use the same criteria to prioritize participants. It will also reach out to other funders to see if they could facilitate participation of some of the requesters. Funded participants will be asked to play an active role at the event (i.e. organize or take part in a session). The OGP Support Unit will additionally strive to strike a geographical and gender balance and fund actors working on a diversity of open government topics.
  content5: The Civil Society Engagement team is process lead for the below.
  content6: "The following criteria are to be used to prioritize civil-society funding recipients:"
  content7: "<b>Priority 1:</b> Civil society from an OGP member country belonging to the national OGP Steering Committee/core team."
  content8: "<li>If more than one CS fits this criteria, CSE team will ask core team to decide among themselves.</li>"
  content9: "<b>Priority 2:</b> Civil society actors active at regional/international level including those from multi-stakeholder initiatives and issue-based coalitions/networks currently working on OGP."
  content10: "<li>The Support Unit will decide based on the relevant OGP activities such actors have employed to date (e.g. support of local processes; participation in working groups; pledges, etc.)</li>"
  content11: "<b>Priority 3:</b> Civil society from an OGP member country that has been involved in national OGP process. The Support Unit will prioritize:"
  content12: "<li>CSOs supporting implementation or monitoring of specific commitments</li><li>CSOs monitoring the overall OGP process</li><li>CSOs working closely with the core team and/or lined-up to join core team</li>"
  content13: "<b>Priority 4:</b> Civil society from OGP eligible – non-member countries that are pushing for membership. The Support Unit will prioritize:"
  content14: "<li>CSOs leading OGP membership advocacy efforts</li>"
  content15: "<b>Priority 5:</b> Civil society from non-eligible OGP countries that are pushing for eligibility."
  content16: "<li>CSOs leading the eligibility advocacy efforts</li>"
  content17: "<b>Priority 6:</b> Civil society from an OGP member country that have interest in engaging with the national OGP process. The Support Unit will prioritize:"
  content18: "<li>CSOs with a solid track record on open government / topics intersecting with open government</li><li>CSOs national core team / government would like to bring into the process</li>"

  content2: "The following are key dates to keep in mind:\n<ul><li>Tuesday March 1 - <strong>Call for speakers, topics of interest, and grant requests</strong></li>\n<li>Friday, March 31 - <strong>End of the call for speakers, topics of interest, and grant requests</strong></li>\n<li>Friday, April 1 - <strong>Registration opens</strong></li>\n<li>April 1-21 - <strong>Deliberations of the Academic Committee and development of the general agenda</strong></li>\n<li>Friday, April 22 - <strong>Deadline for contacting chosen speakers and grantees</strong></li>\n<li>April 22-May 20 - <strong>Co-creation of sessions by speakers</strong></li>\n<li>May 31 - <strong>Civil Society Day</strong></li>\n<li>June 1 & 2 - <strong>EncuentroRegional Americas Encounter of the Open Government Partnership</strong></li>\n</ul>"
  content3: "Once the call for speakers, topics of interest, and grant requests has closed, the Academic Committee will focus on the task of assembling sessions on the agenda <strong>in accordance with the most oft-proposed topics and the OGP’s priority issues and groups of speakers, each led by a facilitator who will carry out the sessions</strong>."
  content4: "Those selected to serve as speakers and facilitators will be contacted via email prior to April 22 and will have three business days to confirm their participation, including those requiring assistance for transport and lodging costs.  Those who accept will receive additional details regarding the layout of the sessions, including points of contact for matters related to content and logistics.  The selection results will be published on the website (<a href=\"http://ogpmontevideo.uy\">ogpmontevideo.uy</a>) after all speakers and facilitators have confirmed their participation."
  content5: Each session’s facilitator is responsible to the Academic Committee for assembling his/her session, as well as for ensuring that a proposal jointly created with the rest of the speakers is submitted to the Committee prior to May 20.  The Academic Committee will suggest to the facilitators a series of possible formats for the sessions, notwithstanding the latter’s proposal of others.  We will particularly insist that sessions promote dialogue more so than statements, as well as the exchange of ideas among the speakers, audience, [and] training entities, as well as external participation in the form of questions, interactive formats, or use of online tools.
